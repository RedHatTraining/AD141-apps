json_ex3.py

A sample task list can be retrieved from
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos.
Get the task list from the above API.
Save the data to two local files, one that contains completed tasks
  and another one that contains incomplete tasks.
The JSON data written to the files should be formatted
  as minimally as possible (no spaces, newlines, etc).
The program should display the number of tasks we have completed.
