""" A Solution For functions_ex03
    There is a built-in function in Python called sum that will return the
    sum of all of the numbers of an iterable object.
    â€¢ Write a similar function, but instead of taking a collection as a
      parameter, the function should take a variable number of arguments
      and return the sum of them.
